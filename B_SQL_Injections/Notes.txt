- Input validation
	- Use regular expressions as whitelists for structured data (such as name, age, income, survey response, zip code) to ensure strong input validation. 
	- In case of a fixed set of values (such as drop-down list, radio button), determine which value is returned. The input data should match one of the offered options exactly.
- Parameterized queries are a means of pre-compiling an SQL statement so that you can then supply the parameters in order for the statement to be executed. 
	This method makes it possible for the database to recognize the code and distinguish it from input data.
- Always use character-escaping functions for user-supplied input provided by each database management system (DBMS). 
	This is done to make sure the DBMS never confuses it with the SQL statement provided by the developer.
